# Re-CenterStage

This project is a reimplementation of FaceTime‚Äôs **Center Stage** feature, designed to dynamically track a user‚Äôs face in a video feed, adjust the frame smoothly, and maintain a natural, user-friendly viewing experience. By combining real-time face detection and tracking with frame adjustments and zoom control, this project demonstrates how advanced computer vision techniques can replicate a seamless auto-framing experience.

## üöÄ Features  

- **Dynamic Auto-Framing**: Keeps the user‚Äôs face in the center area of the frame, dynamically adjusting as they move.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Provides smooth transitions between frames, mimicking the natural movement of a camera.
- **Face Tracking**: Utilizes robust face detection techniques for accuracy, even with partial occlusions.
- **Zoom Control**: Adjusts zoom levels intelligently based on the size of the detected face to ensure clarity.
- **Seamless Transitions**: Ensures that frame changes are gradual and unobtrusive, avoiding a robotic feel.

## üí° What I Learned  

- **Computer Vision Techniques**: Implemented face detection and tracking algorithms using lightweight models like MediaPipe for real-time performance.  
- **Dynamic Frame Adjustment**: Designed and fine-tuned algorithms to translate and scale video frames smoothly.  
- **Optimizing for Edge Devices**: Focused on minimizing latency and ensuring the system is performant even on lower-end hardware.  
- **Human-Centric Design**: Prioritized natural, non-intrusive framing to enhance user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works  

1. **Face Detection**: Detects the user's face in each frame using lightweight and efficient models.  
2. **Tracking and Analysis**: Calculates the face center point (`fcp`) and face size (`fs`) to determine if adjustments are needed.  
3. **Frame Adjustment**: Dynamically translates the frame to center the face while maintaining zoom based on `fs`.  
4. **Smooth Transitions**: Applies easing techniques for frame movement to create natural, camera-like transitions.

## üîÆ Future Directions  

Here are a few ways to take this project further:  

1. **Multi-Person Tracking**: Extend the system to handle multiple faces, prioritizing framing around one or dynamically switching focus.  
2. **Gesture-Based Control**: Incorporate gesture recognition to allow users to manually adjust the frame (e.g., waving to zoom in or out).  
3. **Integration with Video Conferencing**: Package the feature as a plugin or library for tools like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Meet.  
4. **Object Tracking**: Extend the functionality to track other objects (e.g., pets or items) beyond just faces.  
5. **Low-Light Performance**: Enhance detection algorithms to handle challenging lighting conditions more effectively.  
6. **Web Implementation**: Create a browser-based version using WebAssembly or JavaScript frameworks for wider accessibility.  
7. **Edge AI Deployment**: Deploy the system on devices like Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano for on-device processing.  
8. **Augmented Reality Integration**: Overlay AR elements that adapt dynamically based on the tracked face position.

## üõë Limitations  

- **Lighting Sensitivity**: Performance may degrade under low-light or high-exposure conditions.  
- **Processing Speed**: While optimized for real-time, performance may vary depending on the hardware.  
- **Single-Face Focus**: Currently optimized for tracking one face at a time.
